# Work In Progress
This is an inital port of Heathen's Steamworks Foundaiton from Unity to Godot. If you have any issues please let us know via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6X3xrRc) or through the [Issues tracking](https://github.com/heathen-engineering/SteamworksFoundation/issues) here in GitHub.

## Usage
The [Project Template]() folder contains a funcitonal Godot project built on Godot 3.5.1 (mono) and contains Steamworks.NET and Heathen's Steamworks Foundaiton plugin.

### Trouble Shooting
When you first go to run a scene/build your likely to get an error stating the steam_api64.dll could not be found. To correct this simply make sure that the steam_api64.dll is being copied into the output folder on build. For example in Editor it should be copied into `[ProjectRoot]/.mono/temp/bin/debug` for a debug build.

If you have more complex issues or questions please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6X3xrRc) and ask in the communtiy there.

### Updating / Changing Steamworks.NET
Steamworks.NET is the foundation of Heathen's Steamworks Plugin and must be installed. We have included the current version in this template however you can quickly and easily update it by simply downloading the required dll files from [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) and updating them in the project's `Steamworks.NET` folder. 

## Description
_Steamworks Foundation_ is the "lite" version of the [Steamworks Complete](https://www.heathen.group/steamworks) Unity asset and an extension of the work done by [Riley Labrecque](https://github.com/rlabrecque) on [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) and is dependent on it. This asset will check for the presence of [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) and offer to install it in your Unity project for you via Unity's Package Mannager if it is missing.

> You can get [Steamworks Complete](https://www.heathen.group/steamworks), [PhysKit Complete](https://www.heathen.group/physkit) and [UX Complete](https://www.heathen.group/ux) by becoming a [Heathen Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering) here on GitHub!

Heathen’s approach with its Steamworks assets has been to take the strength of [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET), and the parody it has with Valve’s original APIs, and extend that with Unity centric tools, editor extensions and more to make [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) + Heathen the best possible option for Unity developers looking to integrate with Steam. 

With Heathen's Steamworks You retain the strength of directly accessing Steam API when and where you may wish, while having the benefit of not just C# focused but Unity focused tools and extensions as well as systems battle tested across many games from many Unity developers.

Whether you're new to Steam, Godot, or game development in general or a seasoned veteran well capable with the Steam APIs, Heathen’s Steamworks can greatly accelerate your project and help you produce a more robust product that better leverages the services offered by Valve. Heathen’s asset does not prevent you from using raw API calls in conjunction with its own extensions and tools. Many features of Steam API can be handled within Steamworks Complete with little or no coding at all. In the same respect everything is built with respect to the programmer and the need to extend and expand. 

Modular, extensible, and supported by a large community of fellow developers. Heathen’s Steamworks Complete is the best solution for Godot developers looking to ship on the Steam platform.
