2) Select `Add package from git URL...` when prompted provide the following URL:  
`https://github.com/heathen-engineering/Toolkit-for-Steamworks-Foundation.git?path=Unity/com.heathen.steamworksfoundation`  

### Installation Trouble Shooting
Steamworks Foundaiton should only be installed from Unity Package Manager. It will handle the install of dependnecies such as [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) for you. If you have any issues with installing from Unity Package Manager please read our [Package Manager Article](https://kb.heathenengineering.com/company/concepts/package-manager-install) on our Knowledge Base. Manual import is possible but tends to cause problems so we do not directly support it.

## Description
_Steamworks Foundation_ is the "lite" version of the [Steamworks Complete](https://www.heathen.group/steamworks) Unity asset and an extension of the work done by [Riley Labrecque](https://github.com/rlabrecque) on [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) and is dependent on it. This asset will check for the presence of [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) and offer to install it in your Unity project for you via Unity's Package Mannager if it is missing.

> You can get [Steamworks Complete](https://kb.heathen.group/assets/steamworks), [PhysKit Complete](https://kb.heathen.group/assets/physkit) and [UX Complete](https://kb.heathen.group/assets/ux) by becoming a [Heathen Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering) here on GitHub!

Heathen’s approach with its Steamworks assets has been to take the strength of [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET), and the parody it has with Valve’s original APIs, and extend that with Unity centric tools, editor extensions and more to make [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) + Heathen the best possible option for Unity developers looking to integrate with Steam. 

With Heathen's Steamworks You retain the strength of directly accessing Steam API when and where you may wish, while having the benefit of not just C# focused but Unity focused tools and extensions as well as systems battle tested across many games from many Unity developers.

Whether you're new to Steam, Unity, or game development in general or a seasoned veteran well capable with the Steam APIs, Heathen’s Steamworks can greatly accelerate your project and help you produce a more robust product that better leverages the services offered by Valve.

Many features of Steam API can be handled within Steamworks Complete with little or no coding at all. In the same respect everything is built with respect to the programmer and the need to extend and expand. 

Modular, extensible, and supported by a large community of fellow developers. Heathen’s Steamworks Complete is the best solution for Unity developers looking to ship on the Steam platform.
