Heathen’s approach with its Steamworks assets has been to take the strength of [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET), and the parody it has with Valve’s original APIs, and extend that with engine centric tools, editor extensions and more to make [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) + Heathen the best possible option for Unity & Godot (mono) developers looking to integrate with Steam. 

With Heathen's Steamworks You retain the strength of directly accessing Steam API when and where you may wish, while having the benefit of not just C# focused but Unity | Godot (mono) focused tools and extensions as well as systems battle tested cross many games from many developers.

Whether you're new to Steam, [Unity | Godot (mono)], or game development in general or a seasoned veteran well capable with the Steam APIs, Heathen’s Steamworks can greatly accelerate your project and help you produce a more robust product that better leverages the services offered by Valve. Heathen’s asset does not prevent you from using raw API calls in conjunction with its own extensions and tools. Many features of Steam API can be handled within our tools with little or no coding at all. In the same respect everything is built with respect to the programmer and the need to extend and expand.
